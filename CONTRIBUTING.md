## How to contribute

At the moment, the project is in its early stages. If you want to contribute, you can do so by:
- [Opening an issue](https://github.com/kalfasyan/plakakia/issues) to report a bug or request a feature.
- [Opening a pull request](https://github.com/kalfasyan/plakakia/pulls) to fix a bug or add a feature.
- [Contacting me](mailto:kalfasyan@gmail.com) to discuss the project.

The response time might be a bit slow depending on my [postdoc duties](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00107087), but I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.  
  
My goal is to make this library as useful as possible for the community, while trying to learn new things myself. Note that this is my first open-source "library", so I am still learning how to do things properly. Any feedback is welcome!
